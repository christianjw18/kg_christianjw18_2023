This JavaScript application takes in an array of integers as its input (in the form of arguments) and outputs the phonetic equivalencies of the numbers. 

For instance, 3 --> Three, 25 --> TwoFive, 209 --> TwoZeroNine

Run the script in this format:

node main.js [number one] [number 2] [number 3] ... [number n]

For example:
node main.js 3 25 209

This should yield
"Three,TwoFive,TwoZeroNine"
